This change is essential for improving GPU allocation and visibility, ensuring that users can only see and use the GPUs they have specifically requested. Currently, users can see or attempt to use all GPUs on a node, even if those GPUs are allocated to other jobs. This update will prevent such conflicts and ensure fair resource sharing.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Implementing GPU Sharding on L40 Nodes<ul> <li>To further optimize GPU resource management, we will be introducing GPU sharding on the L40 nodes. This will allow better partitioning of GPU resources, giving users more flexibility and control over their workloads while minimizing GPU contention between jobs.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Implementing AUKS SLURM Plugin<ul> <li>The AUKS SLURM plugin extends the Kerberos authentication system in HPC environments. By integrating AUKS with SLURM, jobs can access network resources (HCS) that require Kerberos authentication without user intervention during job execution. After the initial user's Kerberos ticket is obtained on the login node and added to the SLURM AUKS repository, network resources are accessible on all cluster nodes for 7 days.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>What's next?</p> <ul> <li>Slurm Overview</li> <li>Weka</li> </ul>"},{"location":"general/announcements/2025-05-25-maintenance/","title":"April 2025 Maintenance","text":""},{"location":"general/announcements/2025-05-25-maintenance/#aoraki-research-cluster-april-maintenance-complete","title":"Aoraki Research Cluster April Maintenance Complete","text":"<p>The following was implemented as part of this maintenance period:</p> <ul> <li>Expansion of the cluster with additional nodes</li> <li>Storage software upgrade</li> <li>Network migration</li> <li>Enabling cgroups on all GPUs for better resource control</li> <li>Storage configuration updates, including:<ul> <li>Unmounting of the current/scratch directory to finalise deprecation.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>What's next?</p> <ul> <li>Storage Overview </li> </ul>"},{"location":"general/changelogs/2024-05-30-changelog/","title":"May 2024","text":"<p>CHANGES AND FIXES IMPLEMENTED:</p> <p>Breaking changes:</p> <ul> <li>Memory usage is now limited to the amount specified in your Slurm job script.</li> <li>Partitions now have time limits.

Slurm is an open-source resource manager and job scheduling system for HPC (High-Performance Computing) which manages jobs, job steps, nodes, partitions (groups of nodes), and other entities on the cluster. Its main purpose is to allocate and manage resources on a cluster, so that jobs can be run in a way that maximizes utilization of the available resources. In order for SLURM to effectively manage resources,  jobs are submitted to a queue and based on the requested resources the scheduler  will run them to make best utilisation of the cluster. </p> <p>In contrast to the usual interactive mode of running commands on your computer,  the main way of interacting with slurm is to 'batch' your jobs up and submit them.  This 'batching' is usually in the form of a bash script which also includes meta information about  the resource requirements such as the amount of time it's expected to take, along with the number of CPUs and RAM needed. At a minimum, a time-limit needs to be specified for your job at submission.</p> <p>The following is a summary of how to submit jobs and interact with the scheduler.

This way of specifying the number of GPUs to use is in the process of being deprecated.</p> <p>Running a GPU job on Slurm involves specifying the required resources and submitting the job to the scheduler. Here are the basic steps to run a GPU job on Slurm:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Request the required resources.     In order to run a GPU job on Slurm, you need to specify the number of GPUs     and the amount of memory required.     For example, to request a single GPU with 16GB of CPU memory, you would add the     following line to your Slurm job script:</p> <p>Terminal</p> <pre><code>#SBATCH --gpus-per-node=1\n#SBATCH --mem=16GB # 16 GB CPU Memory\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Load the necessary modules.     Depending on the software and libraries you are using you may need to load     additional modules to access the GPU resources.      This can usually be done using the module load command.      For example, to load the CUDA toolkit:</p> <p>Terminal</p> <pre><code>lua\nmodule load cuda\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Write the job script.     Create a job script that specifies the commands and arguments needed to run     your GPU job.     This can include running a CUDA program, a TensorFlow script, or any other     GPU-accelerated code.</p> </li> <li> <p>Submit the job.     Use the sbatch command to submit the job script to the Slurm scheduler.     For example:</p> <p>Terminal</p> <pre><code>sbatch my_gpu_job.sh\n</code></pre> <p>Once your job is submitted, Slurm will allocate the requested resources and schedule the job to run on a node with the appropriate GPU. You can monitor the status of your job using the squeue command and view the output using the sacct command once the job completes.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Here's an example script that will return the information on the GPU available on <code>aoraki_gpu</code>:</p> <p>Terminal</p> <pre><code>#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --account=account_name\n#SBATCH --partition=aoraki_gpu\n#SBATCH --gpus-per-node=1\n#SBATCH --mem=4GB\n#SBATCH --time=00:00:30\nnvidia-smi\n</code></pre> <p>Hint</p> <p>If you want to run a GPU job interactively you can create slurm session on a gpu node (Partition aoraki_gpu_L40 in this example) using the following command which simply adds the <code>--gres=gpu:1</code> flag to the <code>srun</code> command:</p> <p><code>srun --ntasks=1 --partition=aoraki_gpu_L40 --gres=gpu:1  --cpus-per-task=4 --time=0-03:00 --mem=50G --pty  /bin/bash</code></p> <p>For a slightly more involved example consider the following C code.</p> <p>Terminal</p> <pre><code>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\n#define BLOCKS 2\n#define WIDTH 16\n\n__global__ void whereami() {\n  printf(\"I'm thread %d in block %d\\n\", threadIdx.x, blockIdx.x);\n}\n\nint main() {\n  whereami&lt;&lt;&lt;BLOCKS, WIDTH&gt;&gt;&gt;();\n  cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n  return 0;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>If this is stored in the file <code>whereami.cu</code> and compiled with  <code>nvcc whereami.cu -o whereami</code> we can use the Slurm job script</p> <p>Terminal</p> <pre><code>#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --account=account_name\n#SBATCH --partition=aoraki_gpu\n#SBATCH --gpus-per-node=1\n#SBATCH --mem=4GB\n#SBATCH --time=00:00:30\nwhereami\n</code></pre> <p>to obtain output such as the following (ordering of lines may differ):</p> <p>Terminal</p> <pre><code>I'm thread 0 in block 1 \nI'm thread 1 in block 1 \nI'm thread 2 in block 1 \nI'm thread 3 in block 1 \nI'm thread 4 in block 1 \nI'm thread 5 in block 1 \nI'm thread 6 in block 1 \nI'm thread 7 in block 1 \nI'm thread 8 in block 1 \nI'm thread 9 in block 1 \nI'm thread 10 in block 1 \nI'm thread 11 in block 1 \nI'm thread 12 in block 1 \nI'm thread 13 in block 1 \nI'm thread 14 in block 1 \nI'm thread 15 in block 1 \nI'm thread 0 in block 0 \nI'm thread 1 in block 0 \nI'm thread 2 in block 0 \nI'm thread 3 in block 0 \nI'm thread 4 in block 0 \nI'm thread 5 in block 0 \nI'm thread 6 in block 0 \nI'm thread 7 in block 0 \nI'm thread 8 in block 0 \nI'm thread 9 in block 0 \nI'm thread 10 in block 0 \nI'm thread 11 in block 0 \nI'm thread 12 in block 0 \nI'm thread 13 in block 0 \nI'm thread 14 in block 0 \nI'm thread 15 in block 0\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"getting_started/running/batch/using_slurm/slurm_examples/heterogeneous_jobs/","title":"Heterogeneous Jobs","text":"<p>Heterogeneous jobs in Slurm allow you to submit a single job that requests different resources for different job components (job steps).

Instead of submitting many individual jobs, it is best to use an array job as it is more effcient for the scheduler.  A common use case would be to define a job for a sample, and then run the job on all samples in parallel. SLURM facilitates this through the array job type. For an array job there are two bash environment variables that you can  make use of: <code>SLURM_JOBID</code> which is the overall job, and <code>SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID</code> which is the id assigned to  that specific \"subjob\". A common use for the task id would be to use it as an index on a sample sheet.</p> <p>A second benefit of using an array over individually submitting many of the same job is that if you want to rerun a job, you can specify specific array indexes, instead of many differnt job ids.</p> <p>To make use of these variables inside your R task, you can either pass them through as a commandline argument or you can access them from within R with <code>option()</code></p> <p>The scenario for the example will be again calculating the mean for each species in the <code>iris</code> data set but this time instead of using a single job with multiple cores, we'll use a single job per species utilising the SLURM array.</p> <p>Here is an example of running 3 jobs in parallel using a slurm array passing the array index as a commandline argument to R</p> <p>Script: <code>r_array_job_args.R</code></p> <pre><code>args &lt;- commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE)\n# args come in as strings so need to convert to numeric type\nid &lt;- as.numeric(args[1]) \nmessage(paste(\"SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID was: \", id))\n\n# determine which of the species is the target for the job\njob_species &lt;- unique(iris$Species)[id]\nspecies_mean_sepal_length &lt;- mean(iris[iris$Species == job_species, \"Sepal.Length\"])\nresults &lt;- data.frame(species = job_species, mean_sepal_length = species_mean_sepal_length)\nwrite.csv(results, paste0(job_species,\".csv\"), row.names = FALSE)\n</code></pre> <p>Script: <code>run_array_job_example-args.sh</code></p> <pre><code>#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --mem=512MB\n#SBATCH --time=00:01:00\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --array=1-3 # run three of this job with the indexes 1,2,3\n\n# load R v4.4.3 through the modules\nmodule load r/4.4.3\n\n# run the rscript\nRscript r_array_job_example-args.R ${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}\n</code></pre> <p>Submitting the job:</p> <p>Terminal</p> <pre><code>[user@aoraki-login r_examples]$ sbatch run_array_job_example-args.sh\n</code></pre> <p>And here is an example of the same job but instead accessing the system environment variable from within R:</p> <p>Script: <code>r_array_job_example-env.R</code></p> <pre><code># read the environment varible SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID and convert to numeric data type\nid &lt;- as.numeric(Sys.getenv(x = \"SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID\"))\nmessage(paste(\"SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID was: \", id))\n\n# determine which of the species is the target for the job\njob_species &lt;- unique(iris$Species)[id]\nspecies_mean_sepal_length &lt;- mean(iris[iris$Species == job_species, \"Sepal.Length\"])\nresults &lt;- data.frame(species = job_species, mean_sepal_length = species_mean_sepal_length)\nwrite.csv(results, paste0(job_species,\".csv\"), row.names =  FALSE)\n</code></pre> <p>Script: <code>run_array_job_example-env.sh</code></p> <pre><code>#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --mem=512MB\n#SBATCH --time=00:01:00\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\n#SBATCH --array=1-3 # run three of this job with the indexes 1,2,3\n\n# load R v4.4.3 through the modules\nmodule load r/4.4.3\n\n# run the rscript\nRscript r_array_job_example-env.R \n</code></pre> <p>Submitting the job:</p> <p>Terminal</p> <pre><code>[user@aoraki-login r_examples]$ sbatch run_array_job_example-env.sh\n</code></pre> <p>One disadvantage of this approach is it can be harder to create and debug the R code as it relies on environmental variables being set prior to execution,  rather than passing the values at runtime on the commandline through arguments.</p>"},{"location":"getting_started/running/batch/using_slurm/slurm_examples/r-slurm/#slurm-job-dependencies-with-r","title":"SLURM job dependencies with R","text":"<p>SLURM job dependencies allow you to link jobs together and subsequent jobs will only run depending on  the running status of pre-requisite jobs.

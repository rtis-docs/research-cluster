### Using Stata on the Cluster


To use **Stata** on the cluster, a valid license file must be installed.  
This requires authorization details provided by the University’s software procurement office.

Follow the steps below to obtain and configure your Stata license.

#### Steps to Request a License


1. Go to the following page: [https://www.otago.ac.nz/its/services/software/stata](https://www.otago.ac.nz/its/services/software/stata)

2. Click on the **“Software Order Form”** link.

3. In the *Product* field, enter **“Stata”**.

4. The ITS Software Procurement team will email you a **PDF document** containing your:
   
   - **Serial Number**
   - **Code**
   - **Authorization**

5. Once you receive the PDF, **forward it to {{ support_email }}**.

#### Setting Up the License File


After you provide your Stata authorization details, the HPC team will:

- Generate the Stata license file.
- Install it on the cluster for your account.
- Confirm when Stata is ready to use.

Once complete, you will be able to launch Stata directly from your cluster environment.

### Notes


- Stata will not function until a valid license file is in place.
- Licenses are managed centrally to comply with University licensing terms.
- If you already have a Stata license from the University, you may reuse it for cluster access—just forward the PDF with your details.

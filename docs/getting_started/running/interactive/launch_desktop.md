## Launching HPC Desktop

When launching the desktop you can customise the computational components to suit your needs by clicking Advanced options. You can choose between 2 desktop environments XFCE and GNOME. If you have GPU intensive tasks select the "Request GPU" button.

When adjusting other components like cores and memory please refer to the guidelines <!--FIXME make a guidelines page or see if Nesi ones apply https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Getting_Started/Next_Steps/Finding_Job_Efficiency/ https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Getting_Started/Next_Steps/Job_Scaling_Ascertaining_job_dimensions/#initial-python-script https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Getting_Started/Next_Steps/MPI_Scaling_Example/--> or compare the job you want to run to previous jobs you have run.

Increasing compression will increase input lag but is better for low bandwidth connections. For image quality you want to decrease if you have a low bandwidth.

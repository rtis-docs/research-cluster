# Interactive job efficiency

<!-- TODO 
This page should cover 
- where to find the job efficiency metrics for a job
- what metrics matter
- how to use that information to inform your next similar job

-->

Interactive jobs, because of their nature will tend to have poor efficiency metrics, especially for CPU utilisation due to waiting for user input.

The main metric to take note of for interactive jobs is the maximum memory used by the job, if you used less than 75% of the memory requested then it would be a worthwhile consideration to decrease the amount requested the next time you run a similar job.

<!-- TODO reinforce link between size of resources requested and wait time -->

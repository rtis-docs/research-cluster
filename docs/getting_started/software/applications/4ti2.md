# 4ti2 


4ti2 is a software suite for algebraic, geometric, and combinatorial problems on linear spaces. It is available on the cluster via a module.

## Loading the Module


To load 4ti2 version 1.6.11 and its required dependencies (GLPK and GMP):

!!! terminal

    ```bash
    module load 4ti2/1.6.11
    ```

This automatically loads the required modules:

- `glpk/5.0-6xtss3c`
- `gmp/6.2.1`

Once loaded, 4ti2 commands like `zsolve`, `markov`, `groebner`, and others become available in your shell.

## Quick Example: Solving an Integer System


Create a file named `matrix.mat` with the following content:

```text
3 3
1 2 3
0 1 4
3 3 1
```

Then run:

!!! terminal

    ```bash
    zsolve matrix.mat
    ```

This computes the integer kernel of the matrix.

## Common Commands in 4ti2


Some of the frequently used command-line tools in 4ti2 include:

- ``zsolve`` – Solve systems of linear equations over integers
- ``groebner`` – Compute toric Gröbner bases
- ``markov`` – Compute Markov bases
- ``hilbert`` – Compute Hilbert bases
- ``homogenize`` – Homogenize a matrix
- ``dual`` – Compute the dual of a matrix
- ``graver`` – Compute Graver bases

You can get command-line help with:

!!!terminal 

    ```bash
    <command> --help
    ```

For example:

!!! terminal

    ```bash
    groebner --help
    ```

## SLURM Job Script Example


Here’s a sample SLURM batch script for using 4ti2 non-interactively:

!!! terminal 

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH --job-name=4ti2-test
    #SBATCH --time=00:05:00
    #SBATCH --mem=1G
    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
    #SBATCH --output=4ti2-%j.out
    module load 4ti2/1.6.11
    echo "1 1" > test.mat
    echo "1" >> test.mat
    zsolve test.mat
    ```

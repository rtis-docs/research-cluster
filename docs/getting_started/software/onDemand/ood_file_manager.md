# Using the Open OnDemand File Manager

The Open OnDemand File Manager provides a simple way to manage your files on the cluster directly from your web browser.

## Accessing the File Manager

1. Log in to the Open OnDemand portal using your web browser.
2. From the top menu, select **Files > Home Directory** (or another available directory).

## Main Features

- **Browse Directories:** Navigate through your home directory and other accessible storage locations.
- **Upload/Download Files:** Click the "Upload" button to add files from your local computer, or select files and click "Download" to save them to your computer.
- **Create and Delete:** Use the interface to create new folders or files, and to delete items you no longer need.
- **Rename and Move:** Right-click on files or folders to rename or move them.
- **Edit Files:** Click on a text file to open it in the built-in editor for quick changes.

## Tips

- Use the file manager to quickly transfer data between your computer and the cluster.
- For large files or bulk transfers, consider using command-line tools (like `rsync` or `scp`) for better performance. <!-- TODO mention globus -->
- Always organize your files in your home or project directories for easier access and management.

The Open OnDemand File Manager is a convenient tool for everyday file operations and is especially helpful for new users or those who prefer a graphical interface.

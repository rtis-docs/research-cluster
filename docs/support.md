### Technical support

While our team is dedicated to helping you resolve technical issues, most of us are not scientific or domain experts in your field of research. To ensure that we can assist you effectively, please follow the guidelines below when requesting technical support;

Before requesting support, please **check the documentation**. Many common issues are addressed in these resources.
 
To request technical support, please provide the following information:

  * Clear error messages: Copy and paste the exact **error messages** you encounter. This will help us identify the issue quickly.
      * Screenshots may be useful for visual errors in GUI applications, but for text-based output, copy-pasted text or log files are highly preferable. 
  * Command lines or code snippets: Provide the exact commands or code snippets that led to the error. This will enable us to reproduce the issue.
  * Example test dataset: If possible, provide a **minimal, self-contained example dataset** that demonstrates the issue. This will allow us to reproduce the problem and test potential solutions.
  * System information: Include information about the system/resources you are using, such as:
      * Node name/type (e.g., login node, compute node, partition, etc.)
      * Software versions (e.g. application, library, compiler, etc.)
      * Steps to reproduce: Describe the steps you took leading up to the error. This will help us understand the context and reproduce the issue.


## Best Practices for Providing an Example Test Dataset

When providing an example test dataset, please follow these guidelines:

  * Minimize the dataset: Use the smallest possible dataset that still reproduces the issue. This will make it easier for us (and yourself) to diagnose the problem.
  * Make it self-contained: Ensure that the dataset is complete and self-contained, including all necessary input files and dependencies.
  * Use a standard format: Use a standard format for your dataset, such as a text file or a widely-supported binary format.
  * Avoid sensitive data: Remove any sensitive or confidential data from the dataset.

By following these guidelines, you will help us provide you with efficient and effective technical support. 
If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
